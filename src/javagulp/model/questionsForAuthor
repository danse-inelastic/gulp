* Which variables are the six flags of borepuslive/attractive for?  (there are 8 in these settings)

* In example 35 there is the option "eam_functional numeric Ag core ag.dbout" which does not have a 'numeric' part in the help file.

* All the rmin and rmax potential options use ang's as units, correct?

* Does the option 'vary' have the same meaning as specifying the 'variable' keyword? 'vary' is not in gulp.html.

* 'two' and 'exponential' in the genetic algorithm section do not have a format listed.  What is it?

* I don't understand the totalenergy and sbulkenergy options from the documentation description.  Could you explain more?

* One of the options is given as Topic:	gdcrit
Type:	Option
Default:	4.0
Use:	Optimisation of defects involves a force balance method, rather than direct minimisation of the energy. 
The method is implemented in GULP such that initially the energy is minimised until the gradient norm is sufficiently 
small, at which point the step length is based on -(H-1).g and no line search is used (where H = second derivative 
matrix and g = gradient vector). gdcrit sets the criterion for switching between these minimisation methods.

but there is no description of how to alter it to achieve its purpose.  Could this description be enlarged?

* I somewhat understand dminimum and dmaximum but would like a clearer explanation.  What exactly are 
we setting to minimum or maximum?  Is the default zero for x, y, and z?  

* Could you give me an example of how cvec is meant to be used?

* What does sum_cons and sum_cst mean in
aver sum_velocity_squared sum_energy sum_virial sum_temperature sum_cons sum_cst no_of_averaging_points
(I'm guessing constraints and constants but it would be nice to know which)?

* in the four body potentials you typically have bond and inter/intra as two separate options, but in torexp it is:
torexp <<bond/intra/inter>gt; 
as one option.  Is it really one option or is this just a typo?

* what do you mean by "atom number in the unit cell" in monopoleq?  Is this a line number in the coordinate list?

* what is the <n> for all the observable options?

* what are the units for "charge" in cartesian, species, etc.?
